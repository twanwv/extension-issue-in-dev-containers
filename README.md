# Extensions not/partially loading in VSCode 1.76.0

Note: This is not working for me, but it could be that I'm doing something wrong.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Clone repo
2. Open in dev container
3. Check which extensions are installed inside the dev container (expected 14), but the number differs between 5 and 10.

When excuting the steps in VSCode 1.75.1 all extensions are loaded correctly.
